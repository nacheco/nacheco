<h3>ðŸŒŸ What Iâ€™m About</h3>

  Iâ€™m a builder who loves crafting software that solves real problemsâ€”like bridging the gap between expert knowledge and the next generation of leaders at <a href="https://tryparsly.com">Parsly</a>. I thrive on turning tricky business logic into clean, fast code and failing fast to learn faster. With a mix of software engineering, design, and a passion for impact, Iâ€™m here to make a dent in the universe, one line of code at a time.
